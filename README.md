# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
- This application is designed to generate SVG logos dynamically based on user input.
  Leveraging JavaScript, Node.js, Inquirer version 8.2.4, and Jest version 29.7, this project allows users to create custom SVG logos with ease.
  Users can select the color of the logo's shape and text.
  Through the development of this application, I gained valuable experience in utilizing constructors and performing tests using Jest.


## Installation
- This application requires Node.js, Inquirer version 8.2.4, and Jest version 29.7 to run correctly.

## Usage
- To initiate the program, run 'node index.js' in the terminal. Follow the prompted questions to generate an SVG logo according to your preferences. Additionally, you can run tests using Jest by entering 'npm test' in the terminal.
